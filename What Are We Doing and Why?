#What Are We Doing and Why?
We’ll focus on securing a Windows environment, specifically:
- Creating and applying Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce password policies and other security settings.
- Hardening the Administrator account and login process.

# Why This Matters:
Protects accounts from brute-force and password reuse attacks.
Limits what attackers can do if they get access.
Shows real-world blue team experience — great for LinkedIn, CVs, or interviews.
Helps you understand Windows security controls from the inside out.

# What You’ll Need:
Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise (not Home edition). They are both Required for Group Policy Editor and Active Directory features.
Administrator rights To edit security settings
Patience & Curiosity coz This is how pros are made
