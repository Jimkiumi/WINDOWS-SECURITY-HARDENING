A step-by-step documentation of my journey applying Windows security hardening techniques as part of blue teaming practice.
# WINDOWS-SECURITY-HARDENING: A BLUE TEAM PRACTICE
## Introduction

This project documents the security hardening tasks I performed on my personal Windows machine to simulate a Secure Admin Workstation (SAW). These configurations are foundational practices in blue teaming to defend against common attack vectors by tightening system-level policies, enabling exploit mitigation features, and improving visibility through auditing.

Inspired by real-world enterprise defense techniques, this setup follows practical hardening measures like:
- Strong password and lockout policies
- Disabling vulnerable system features
- Enabling Windows Defender's Exploit Guard
- Setting up local auditing to track logon attempts
